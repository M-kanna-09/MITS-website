    <h2>About the Programme</h2>
    <p>
        The Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at MITS Madanapalle is a four-year undergraduate program that focuses on the design, development, and testing of electronic systems, communication networks, and embedded technologies. The program aims to provide students with both theoretical foundations and practical skills required in the rapidly evolving electronics and telecommunication industries.
        <br><br>
        The ECE curriculum covers diverse areas including Analog and Digital Electronics, Communication Systems, VLSI Design, Signal Processing, Microprocessors, Embedded Systems, and Internet of Things (IoT). The program also integrates training in modern simulation tools and hardware platforms to ensure students gain hands-on exposure.
        <br><br>
        Students are encouraged to participate in electronics design projects, industry internships, technical symposiums, and research initiatives to sharpen their practical and analytical abilities.
        <br><br>
        The objective of the program is to produce competent engineers capable of contributing to fields such as telecommunications, consumer electronics, embedded systems, VLSI, robotics, and wireless communication.
