    <h2>About the Programme</h2>
    <p>
        The Master of Technology (M.Tech) in VLSI Design at MITS Madanapalle is a two-year postgraduate program that focuses on the design, development, and verification of Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits and systems. The program equips students with advanced knowledge in semiconductor technology, chip design, embedded systems, and hardware description languages.
        <br><br>
        The VLSI Design curriculum includes core subjects such as Digital System Design, Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, ASIC Design, FPGA Design, Low Power VLSI, CMOS Design, and VLSI Testing and Verification. The program emphasizes practical exposure through simulation tools like Cadence, Synopsys, and Xilinx, along with hands-on projects and industry collaborations.
        <br><br>
        Students will work on real-time VLSI design challenges, participate in chip design workshops, and complete dissertation projects that prepare them for careers in semiconductor industries, embedded system companies, and electronic design automation (EDA) sectors.
        <br><br>
        Graduates of this program can pursue roles such as VLSI Design Engineer, Verification Engineer, FPGA Developer, ASIC Design Engineer, and Research Analyst in core electronics and semiconductor industries.
