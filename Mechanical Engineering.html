    <h2>About the Programme</h2>
    <p>
        The Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering at MITS Madanapalle is a four-year undergraduate program that focuses on the design, development, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. Mechanical Engineering is one of the broadest and most versatile engineering disciplines that provides strong foundations in core areas such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, material science, manufacturing processes, machine design, and robotics.
        <br><br>
        The curriculum is structured to develop analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and practical engineering skills through hands-on training, laboratory experiments, industrial visits, and project-based learning. Students are also exposed to modern technologies like Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and CNC machining.
        <br><br>
        The program equips students for careers in industries such as automotive, aerospace, energy, manufacturing, construction, robotics, and thermal power plants. It also prepares graduates for higher education, competitive exams, and research opportunities in mechanical and interdisciplinary domains.
